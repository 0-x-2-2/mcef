# MCEF
Minecraft Chromium Embedded Framework (MCEF) is an API to allow Minecraft Modders to add custom web browsers into Minecraft.
The project was initialy made for WebDisplays (www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291044-web-displays-browse-on-the-internet-in-minecraft).
It is based on JCEF (https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/), which is based on CEF (https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/) which is based on chromium (http://www.chromium.org).

# Currently supported platforms
Right now MCEF supports Windows 32 and 64 bits. I'll compile JCEF for linux as soon as possible. However I can't compile it for Mac.
If you want to compile the natives for Mac, you can follow the instructions here: https://code.google.com/p/javachromiumembedded/wiki/BranchesAndBuilding
On checkout, please take the revision 113.
